# Overview

In Manuscript v2, we implemented necessary improvements to our Summarizer. All relevant textual data involved in this improvement are provided in this file dir.

## Data Sources

| **Related_HPO_Terms** | Specific HPO terminology associated with the disease |
| **Extracted_Content** | Text output from DeepSeek-R1-671B, generated using input format: `{Prompt + HPO_Description}` |

### OMIM Dataset (`DeepSeek_R1_671B_Response_OMIM.csv`)
